#  Chapter 6: Analysis of longitudinal data

## The analyses of Chapter 8 of MABS using the RATS data
 The data is derived from a  nutrition study conducted in three groups of rats (Crowder and Hand, 1990). The three rat groups were put on different diets, and each animalâ€™s body weight (grams) was recorded repeatedly (approximately weekly). The question of most interest is whether the growth profiles of the three groups differ.

### Graphical displays of standardized and non-standardized data
```{r}
library(dplyr); library(tidyr); library(ggplot2); library(readr)

#read the long form table created in the data wrangling exercise
RATSL <- read_csv("RATSL.csv")
summary(RATSL)
View(RATSL)

#making sure the variables are factorized after reading the csv
RATSL$ID <- factor(RATSL$ID)
RATSL$Group <- factor(RATSL$Group)


#draw a plot (all groups and all rats)
ggplot(RATSL, aes(x = Time, y = Weight, linetype = ID)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_linetype_manual(values = rep(1:10, times=4)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ Group, labeller = label_both) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(min(RATSL$Weight), max(RATSL$Weight)))

#standardize the variable weight (and later plot again all rats)
RATSL <- RATSL %>%
  group_by("Time") %>%
  mutate(stdbprs = "Weight") %>%
  ungroup()

RATSL <- RATSL %>%
  group_by(Time) %>%
  mutate( stdweight = (Weight - mean(Weight))/sd(Weight) ) %>%
  ungroup()

# Glimpse the data
glimpse(RATSL)

# Plot again (all rats) with the standardised weight
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(RATSL, aes(x = Time, y = stdweight, linetype = ID)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_linetype_manual(values = rep(1:10, times=4)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ Group, labeller = label_both) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "standardized Weights")


```


An important effect we want to take notice is how the rats who have higher weights  at the beginning  have higher weights throughout the study. This phenomenon is called  tracking.

All the rats also increase in weight during the study. The rats are quite homogenous with  their group members, meaning there is not much inside group variability in weights (dispite the one obvious outlier in group 2). The different rat groups differ in their weight significantly and by visual judgment there seems to be a significant outlier in group 2. 

Judgding by the plot of  standardized data, the weight gained throughout the study seems to be a bit smaller in the group 2 in comparison to the other groups. 


### Summary measure analysis of longitudinal data (weight)
```{r}

# Number of subjects (per group):
n <- 16

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
# Summary data with mean and standard error of Weight by group and time
#install.packages("plotrix") #needed for std.error function 
library("plotrix")

RATSS <- RATSL %>%
  group_by(Group, Time) %>%
  summarise( mean = mean(Weight), se = std.error(Weight)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Glimpse the data
glimpse(RATSS)


# Plot the mean profiles
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(RATSS, aes(x = Time, y = mean, linetype = Group, shape = Group)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_linetype_manual(values = c(1:3)) +
  geom_point(size=3) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(1:3)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=mean-se, ymax=mean+se, linetype="1"), width=0.3) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.8,0.8)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "mean(Weight) +/- se(Weight)")

# Draw a boxplot of the mean versus Group
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(RATSS, aes(x = Group, y = mean)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  stat_summary(fun = "mean", geom = "point", shape=23, size=4, fill = "white") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "mean(Weight), Time 1-50")

#Here we still create a summary data by  Group and ID where baseline (Time=1) is filtered out. 
RATSLF <- RATSL %>%
  filter(Time > 1) %>%
  group_by(Group, ID) %>% 
  summarise( mean=mean(Weight) ) %>%
  ungroup()

#plotting the filtered data
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(RATSLF, aes(x = Group, y = mean)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  stat_summary(fun = "mean", geom = "point", shape=23, size=4, fill = "white") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "mean(Weight), Time 8-55")


# Create a new data by filtering the outlier we saw in group two and adjust the ggplot code the draw the plot once again 
RATSL_ <- RATSLF %>% filter(mean < 550) 

ggplot(RATSL_, aes(x = Group, y = mean)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  stat_summary(fun = "mean", geom = "point", shape=23, size=4, fill = "white") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "mean(Weight), Time 8-55")


```



It has been argued that  the average response to treatment over
time is often likely to be the most relevant summary statistic in treatment trials.  This is why weight (=the response) was chosen as the summary measure.  The groups differ from each others since their mean Weights and their standard errors are not on top of one another on this boxplot.  Especially group 1 locates far away from groups 2-3 and seems to differ significantly.

No outliers were found in the boxplot when Time point 1 is included. When the Time point 1 was chosen as baseline and exlcuded from the summary data, we can see an outlier in every group. Only the outlier of group 2 was eventually excluded because it stood out so strongly and the others were included in this analysis.

### Summary measure analysis (for the growth variable)

Since there seem to be rather huge differences in the starting weights between the groups, I decided to test the group differences in  percent increase in growth during the follow up time. The variable "growth" was defined already in the data wrangling part (meet_and_repeat.R) from the original longitudinal data RATS by the following  equation (RATS$WD64-RATS$WD1)/RATS$WD1.

```{r}

# Number of subjects:
n <- 16

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
# Summary data with mean and standard error of Weight by group and time
#install.packages("plotrix") #needed for std.error function 
library("plotrix")

RATSSg <- RATSL %>%
 group_by(Group, Time) %>%
  summarise( mean2 = mean(growth), se2 = std.error(growth)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Plot the mean profiles
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(RATSSg, aes(x = Group, y = mean2, shape = Group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(size=3)  +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=mean2-se2, ymax=mean2+se2, linetype="1"), width=0.3) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.8,0.8)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "mean percentage increase in growth.")


```

Boxplot results: The mean percentage increase in growth  seems to have been greatest in Group 2. Group 1 and 3 are on top of each others and the growth has been rather identical. Whiskers show the  range of percentage increase in growth. 


###  Anova - a formal test for difference

Anova confirms here that the group differences we were able to see in the plots were real. P-values were significant  and this means there is significant difference in  mean weights between groups. There was also significant difference in group 2  growth as judged by the plottings.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)


# Fit the linear model with the mean (weight) as the response 
fit <- lm(mean ~  Group, data = RATSL_)
summary(fit)

# Fit the linear model with the  %-growth in weight as the response. First we filter out the  outlier found previously
RATSLG <- RATSL %>% filter(ID != 12)
fit2 <- lm(growth ~  Group, data = RATSLG)
summary(fit2)

# Compute the analysis of variance table for the fitted model with anova()
anova(fit)
anova(fit2)

View(RATSSg)
View(RATSL)

```


##  The analyses of Chapter 9 of MABS using the BPRS data
In the BPRS data 40 male subjects were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups and each subject was rated on the brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS) measured before treatment began (week 0) and then at weekly intervals for eight weeks. The BPRS assesses the level of 18 symptom constructs such as hostility, suspiciousness, hallucinations and grandiosity; each of these is rated from one (not present) to seven (extremely severe). The scale is used to evaluate patients suspected of having
schizophrenia.

### Plot
```{r} 
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

#read data in long form
#read the long form table created in the data wrangling exercise
BPRSL <- read_csv("BPRSL.csv")
summary(BPRSL)
#View(BPRSL)
#factor variables
BPRSL$treatment <- factor(BPRSL$treatment)
BPRSL$subject <- factor(BPRSL$subject)

# Plot the  data
ggplot(BPRSL, aes(x = week, y = bprs, linetype = subject)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_linetype_manual(values = rep(1:10, times=4)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ treatment, labeller = label_both) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(min(BPRSL$bprs), max(BPRSL$bprs)))

# Standardise the variable bprs
BPRSL <- BPRSL %>%
  group_by("week") %>%
  mutate(stdbprs = "bprs") %>%
  ungroup()

BPRSL <- BPRSL %>%
  group_by(week) %>%
  mutate( stdbprs = (bprs - mean(bprs))/sd(bprs) ) %>%
  ungroup()

# Plot again with the standardised bprs
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(BPRSL, aes(x = week, y = stdbprs, linetype = subject)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_linetype_manual(values = rep(1:10, times=4)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ treatment, labeller = label_both) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "standardized bprs")

```

By visual judging there seems to be a modest downward trend in BPRS for both treatments during the study. 

### Linear Mixed Effects Models
```{r} 

# create a regression model
BPRSL_reg <- lm(bprs ~ week + treatment, data=BPRSL)

# print out a summary of the model
summary(BPRSL_reg)

```

In this model time seems to have statistically significant lowering effect on  BPRS points (p-value < 0.05, and BPRS is on average 2.27 points lower every week). The two treatment groups did not have statistically significant difference. 


### Random Intercept and Random Slope Model (without and with interaction)
```{r} 

#the random intercept model
library(lme4)
BPRSL_ref <- lmer(bprs ~ week + treatment + (1 | subject), data = BPRSL, REML = FALSE)

# Print the summary of the model
summary(BPRSL_ref)

#create a random intercept and random slope model. 
library(lme4)
BPRSL_ref1 <- lmer(bprs ~ week + treatment + (week | subject), data = BPRSL, REML = FALSE)

# print a summary of the model
summary(BPRSL_ref1)

# perform an ANOVA test on the two models
anova(BPRSL_ref1, BPRSL_ref)


# Random intercept and random slope model with time x treatment interaction 
BPRSL_ref2 <- lmer(bprs ~ week + treatment + (week | subject) + week * treatment, data = BPRSL, REML = FALSE)
summary(BPRSL_ref2)

``` 

The results were not statiscially significant for the Random Intercept and Random Slope Models. So all our models failed to provide a reasonable approximation of the final results and in addition there is  no evidence of a treatment difference  between the groups.

ANOVA: our second model (BPRSL_ref1) seems to have a higher  log-likelihood and it seems to perform better in approximating the bprs points  and the difference seems to be statistically significant.

```

I heard about this course on the university mailing list. I thought this course might be useful, because I just started working in a research project where the other researches have previously utilized R. However, at the moment I feel a bit overewhelmed after realizing it really takes quite a lot of work to be able to fluently use the language for my own projects in the future.
